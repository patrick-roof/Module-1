## Description

 - My motivation for this project is to improve the codebase of the Horiseon website so that it meets accessibility standards.
 - It will have semantic HTML, a logical structure, accessible image and descriptive attributes.
 - While working on this project I've learned a lot about accessible websites, properly organized HTML, and how different tags can be used to express the same idea.


## Usage

This project contains HTML code that has been organized and refactored, and a CSS that has been slightly modified to match the HTML.
It is designed for the Horiseon customers to showcase the company, and the different aread the company specializes in.
The changes made are mostly shown in the DevTools console to improve accessibility.
